Context from knowledge base: {{context}}

Complete interview history:
{{history}}

Prepare a brief clinical report in {language} based strictly on the information gathered during the interview. 
Date to specify in the report: {current_date}
- Use only the terms, criteria for diagnosis, and categories for clinical diagnosis or classifications 
that are present in the provided knowledge base. Do not introduce any external information or terminology. 
* In your diagnosis, you must be very careful. That is, you need to have enough evidence and information to rate or diagnose a patient.
* Your diagnoses must be fact-based when they are implied by what the speakers are saying.
* Write technical, clinical or professional terms only in the English language.
* As a rule, in cases where there is little information about the patient through the conversation or through
the things they say, the diagnosis will be more difficult, and the ratings will be lower, 
because it is difficult to draw conclusions when our information about the patient is scarce. 
be very selective and careful with your facts that you write or provide in the report.
in such a case, this also must be mentioned and taken into consideration.
* Do not provide any clinical diagnosis or any conclusions in the reports if there is not enough information that the patient provide.
* Any diagnosis or interpretation requires the presentation of facts, foundations, and explanations.
* You can also give examples or quotes.
* There are two parts for the report - main report and additional report.
* Structure the main report to include observed symptoms, potential diagnoses (if applicable), and any other 
relevant clinical observations, all within the framework of the given knowledge.

First, write the main report, than, in addition to the main report, add the following sections as the additional report:
