![Clinical Psychologist Interviewer ùöø Icon](appendix/icon.jpeg)

**Clinical Psychologist Interviewer ùöø** is an AI platform designed to simulate clinical interviews. It leverages NLP and speech technologies to emulate a clinical psychologist, offering insightful assessments and generating detailed clinical reports. 

This platform is ideal for educational, research, and preliminary assessment purposes but should not replace professional medical advice.

## Features

This platform integrates several sophisticated features to deliver its functionalities seamlessly. It conducts interviews with preset psychological questions, understands user responses, and generates contextually relevant follow-up questions using NLP. It supports audio interactions by converting text questions into speech and transcribing user audio responses into text. Moreover, it automatically generates detailed clinical reports based on the interviews, and users can upload TXT, PDF, or DOCX files to create reports from document content. Multi-language support ensures that interviews and reports can be conducted and generated in the user‚Äôs preferred language.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Document Retrieval Process

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a method that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing. In this project, RAG helps to ensure that the interview questions generated by the AI are both contextually relevant and grounded in authoritative sources. Here‚Äôs how the RAG process works to retrieve only relevant documents:

1. **Document Embeddings**: The documents are converted into embeddings using OpenAI‚Äôs embedding models. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text and are used to facilitate efficient retrieval.
2. **FAISS Indexing**: The embeddings are stored in a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index. FAISS is optimized for similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, making it ideal for this purpose.
3. **Query Embedding**: When a user input or interview context is provided, it is also converted into an embedding.
4. **Similarity Search**: The query embedding is used to search the FAISS index to retrieve the most relevant documents based on their embeddings.
5. **Top-K Retrieval**: The system retrieves the top-K documents that are most similar to the user‚Äôs query embedding. These documents are then used to generate the next interview question, ensuring that the responses are based on relevant and accurate information.

## Documents and Knowledge Database

The platform uses a rich set of documents and knowledge bases to inform the AI‚Äôs questioning and reporting processes. These documents include:

- **DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition)**: Provides standardized criteria for the diagnosis of mental health conditions.
- **PDM-2 (Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual, 2nd Edition)**: Offers a psychodynamic perspective on mental health diagnosis.
- **Personalities Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions of various personality types and traits.
- **Defence Mechanisms**: Information on psychological strategies used by individuals to cope with reality and maintain self-image.
- **Big Five Traits**: Descriptions of the five-factor model of personality traits, including Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
- **Attachment Styles**: Framework for understanding different types of attachment in interpersonal relationships, such as Secure, Anxious-Preoccupied, Dismissive-Avoidant, and Fearful-Avoidant.
- **Interview Conduction Guides for Clinical Psychologists**: Guidelines and best practices for conducting clinical interviews.

These documents are processed and indexed, enabling the AI to retrieve relevant excerpts during the interview to generate questions that are grounded in established psychological knowledge.

## User Interface

The user interface, built with Gradio, is intuitive and interactive, consisting of two main tabs: **Interview** and **Upload Document**.

### Interview Tab

The session starts with an introductory message delivered in both text and audio formats. Users respond by typing or recording audio responses, which the AI processes to generate and return relevant follow-up questions based on context and the retrieved documents. The conversation continues until a predetermined number of questions have been asked. At the end of the session, a detailed clinical report is generated and available for download as a PDF.

### Upload Document Tab

Users can upload existing documents and specify their preferred language. The system analyzes the document content and generates a detailed clinical report, which can be displayed and downloaded.

## Contextual and Historical Relevance

Throughout the interview process, the AI uses all chat history to ensure that each follow-up question is contextually relevant. By leveraging both the immediate user input and the full history of the conversation, the AI can provide a coherent and comprehensive interview experience. The use of RAG ensures that the follow-up questions are informed not only by the user's previous responses but also by the most relevant and authoritative information available in the knowledge base.

## Disclaimer

This platform is a simulation and should not replace professional medical advice. Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns.
