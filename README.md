3. **Session Conclusion**: After a set number of questions, the session concludes with a closing message.
4. **Report Generation**: A detailed clinical report is generated and can be downloaded as a PDF.

### Upload Document Tab

1. **File Upload**: Users upload TXT, PDF, or DOCX files.
2. **Language Preference**: The user specifies the preferred language for the report.
3. **Report Creation**: The system analyzes the document content and generates a clinical report.
4. **Download Report**: The generated report is available for download in PDF format.

## Core Functionalities

### Initial Setup and Response Handling

The platform begins with an initial setup where an introductory message is provided. As users interact, their inputs are processed to generate appropriate follow-up questions. These questions are then converted into speech using OpenAI‚Äôs text-to-speech technology.

### Audio Interaction and Conversion

The interaction includes converting text questions to speech and transcribing user audio responses back into text, ensuring the conversation remains fluid and engaging.

### Report Generation

Upon completion of the interview session, a comprehensive clinical report is created, detailing observations and insights based on user responses. This report can be downloaded as a PDF.

### Document-Based Report Generation

Users can generate reports from existing documents by uploading TXT, PDF, or DOCX files. The system processes the content and creates a detailed clinical report in the specified language.

## Important Details

- **Temporary Files**: The platform manages temporary audio files efficiently, ensuring they are cleaned up after use.
- **Language and Model Support**: Multiple language support and model configurations ensure accurate and contextually relevant interactions.
